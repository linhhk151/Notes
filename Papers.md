*"Self-driving cars are one of many technologies with enormous potential to radically improve human health and well-being; that’s why we want to create them. Machine learning, with its ability to harness incredible computing power to create systems that can evaluate massive quantities of data and make decisions in real-time, is one answer to how we can make this a reality. And of course artificial intelligence itself is what we want to achieve—machines that can mimic human-level intelligence."*

**[Brain for Cars](http://brain4cars.com/)**:

Brain for Cars is a project whose mission is to anticipate the driver's behaviors. If the driver is about to commit a risky driving manuever, he will be alerted. The main technology behind it is combining multiple LSTM networks to predict a number of categorized driving behaviors.

Transportation industry costs a huge amount of money every year for maintenance, repair costs, accidents and mortality. How can IoT and Machine Learning help reducing this spending? IoT provides a huge amount of data about the drivers' driving habits and condition of their cars. ML provides models to improve driving behaviors, predict disasters and detect road failures.
