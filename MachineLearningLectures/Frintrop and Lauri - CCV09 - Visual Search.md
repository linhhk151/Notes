# General ideas

The guiding for search (topdown signals) happens constantly until the search stops - humans constantly think about the features of the object that are being looked for.

The most important questions are:

1. Given a attention system in FIT - liked (Koch-Ullman, Itti-Ullman, VOCUS2), where should we put the top down cues into?

2. How to encode the topdown signals?

3. How to integrate that signals to the system? Excitation or Inhibition? <- interesting here, how to do inhibition? Should the top down cues repeatedly inject to the system?

Page 14 wrote

"Several research findings indicate that both, excitation and inhibition are important in human visual attention."
