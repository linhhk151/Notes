Phần 2: Five steps into the void.

Most of us are familiar with the following classical puzzle: can a 8x8 board with two cells at the left-top and right-bottom
are cut off be perfectly fit by 2x1 dominos?

Personally I have encountered this puzzle and its variants on multiple occasions. The trick to solve this puzzle is see the board as
not some ordinary board but a chessboard. What differences does it make? A chessboard has black and white cells. And black and white
can be seen as 0 and 1, which are two possible values of parity. Using parity, answering the original puzzle and its variant can be done by comparing the parity of the board and of all the dominos needed.

It's obvious that the parity check idea above would not have been usable if we did not turn the ordinary board to a chessboard. The 
way the board is seen plays a crucial role in solving the puzzle. The shift in perspective also proves its effectiveness in the checkerboard jumping problem: prove that it is impossible to advance one soldier 5 steps into the enemy's field. The idea of defining some sort of quality on each soldier and then prove that we need the total of infinitely large number of soldiers to reach the same quality of the destination is truly groundbreaking. 

How we see the world really changes what we are.

The thing is, how would one come up with such kind of perspective shift? What kind of practice would one need to go through, or how many problems one must solve in order to be good at it?

Btw, the direction of inequality between r^{k}, r^{k+1} and r{k+2} in the book is incorrect. It should be r{k+2} + r{k+1} >= r^{k}.
